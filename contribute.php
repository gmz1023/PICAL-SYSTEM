		<li><h2>6-18-2022</h2>
		<li><h3>Improvements</h3>
				<dl>
				<dd>The Sim has been upgraded to be a bit smoother and faster</dd>
				<dd>Due to new complexifications the sim is now clunkier and slower</dd>
				</dl>
	  <li>
				Genetics Systems<ul>
	  <li>Added Candles with higher caloric intake</li>
				<li>Added Genetic Disorders</li>
		  </ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Pregnancy Subsystem Improved
				<ul>
	<li>Code was 500 lines of redudancy, now is down to a quarter of that.</li>
	<li>Added New "They had sex" messages</li>
				</ul>
					</li>
		<li><h3>New Systems</h3></dt>
	  <li>Intelligence System -- Intelligence system currently only effects Tile Improvements; Wells, farms, ranches,etc will only be built if the average IQ is 100
	  <dd>The System is not perfect and will need some fine tuning but it is mostly there to improve some smaller issues with math issues</dd></li>
						
	<li><h3>Known Issues</h3>
		<ul>
				<li>Genetic Disorder Rate is Too High and/or rate in which it takes away candle health is too frequent.</li>
				<li>Due to some candles having a higher caloric intake -- water supplies are becoming negative. This may end up staying if the weather system is implemented, but the weather system is further into the pipeline</li>
		</ul>
			</li>
		<li><h2>6-13-2022</h2><ul>
			<li>Improved the coding -- Most of it was written about 10 years ago by some idiot. Oh wait, that's me. Things should run better now</li>
			<li>Added functionality for Wells, Ranches, and Farms. The maps coming next... hopefully</li>
			<li>Fixed the "Agent Smith" glitch - Asexual Reproduction should no longer accure without a reason. And the resons for it to accure have yet to be implemented</li>
			<li>General Well Being Fixes For Candles</li>
		</ul>
		</lI>
	</ul>
	<h1>Roadmap</h1>
	<ul>
		<li>Improvements<ul>
			<li>De-link the processes that run the simulator so that things can run in parallel instead of in a chain</li>
			<li>Figure out how to run the simulation on AWS so that the run time can be improved</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Features
			<ul>
				<li>Add your own characters to the system -- With In Reason</li>
				<li>Full Lineage Breakdown - Trace a candles lineage back to God</li>

						<li>Betting/Score - Bet on which lineage you think will survive</li>
						<li>"Supply Drops" - Drop supplies to help candle you like</li>
					</ul></li>
